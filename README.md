# Bike share trip planner app

This is the source code for my [bike share trip planner app](bike-share-trip-planner.herokuapp.com), a python-driven app that uses current station data, along with predictions generated by a [Gradient boosting tree](href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) model, to predict bike and dock availability for stations in New York's CitiBike system. It currently directs you to the ideal station to get a bike at start of your trip, as well as the ideal station to dock your bike at the end. Code for parsing citibike data and training the models is in analysis_code.
